Hey guys, so heres just a quick readme we can remove later. This is just for you 
guys to know exactly what i did without guessing. So for the front end i used 
react/vite, and for the backend I got flask going. I think the architecture this is
currently in is alright (was trying to follow what vivek had) ANYWAYS feel free
to change ANYTHING. seriously im not great at front end nor am i artistically 
gifted. Just let me know if you need ME to change anything or explain anything!!

if we feel like we dont wanna use react/vite please let me know, itll be a lotta
work to change back but i know i can, the sooner the better.

However, if we're feeling ok with this, this is how you kinda run this.
Make sure to have GIT, python, node.js + npm (react/vite) installed

Also adjust db.py on the backend to your actual password.

1) clone the repo into what you use (im using vscode)
2) using terminal, cd into the backend
3) Install flask if you havent with: pip install flask flask-cors mysql-connector-python
4) On the backend, run python app.py (terminal)
5) With that backend terminal running, open a new terminal on the frontend folder
6) npm install for any npm dependences (first time only)
7) enter: npm run dev
8) Open the link from that and it should bring you to a placeholder home page!

That is about it, feel free to put anything into gpt that you dont really get or just ask,
I might know. I hope this is okay, I have a lot more im working on, but I just wanted to
put this here now. Also if you wanted to like go to my page, you would enter the local host 
url in the url + / groups. Eg "http://localhost:5173/groups"
