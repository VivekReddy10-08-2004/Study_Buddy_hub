Data Structures,Array,"An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/array-data-structure-guide/,LINK
Data Structures,Linked Lists,"Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/linked-list-data-structure/,LINK
Data Structures,Stack,"Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). In stack, all insertion and deletion are permitted at only one end of the list.",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/stack-data-structure/,LINK
Data Structures,Queue,"Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In the queue, items are inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/queue-data-structure/,LINK
Data Structures,Binary Tree,"Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links.A Binary Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of root is NULL. A Binary Tree node contains the following parts.",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/binary-tree-data-structure/,LINK

Data Structures,Hash Table Data Structure,Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/hash-table-data-structure/,LINK
Data Structures,Matrix,A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/matrix/,LINK
Data Structures,Trie,"Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to an optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in the binary search tree, a well-balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However, the penalty is on Trie storage requirements.",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/trie-insert-and-search/,LINK
