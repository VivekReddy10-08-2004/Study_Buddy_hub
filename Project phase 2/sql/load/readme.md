The scripts I (Vivek) made to insert my scrapped and cleaned data into my schema.

### insert_resources.sql 

This file was generated by the Course Resource Cleaner python program. The file contains SQL code containing the values of the cleaned data in order to populate the Resource table in the StudyBuddy database.
- ensures a dedicated system user exists for resource uploads
- Takes the user's actual ID with 'LAST_INSERT_ID()' and stores in in              '@uploader_id'
- Does a transaction and inserts each row of cleaned resources
- Creates and resuses the System Seeder user so uploads from the system are tied to non student accounts
